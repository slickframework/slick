**Installation**

The best way to get started with Slick framework is using composer. We
have created a template that get you with a base web application files
and directory structure. To start a project using our web application
template run

    $ composer create-project slick/webapp <your-app-name>

If you wat to use a Slick module in your existing project just add the
corespondent module name your project `composer.json` file. Lets have an
example. Adding the `slick/template` Slick module to your project is as
simple as adding the following line to your projectâ€™s `composer.json`
file:

    {
        "require": {
            "slick/template": "1.0.*@dev",
            ...
        }
    }

Then you need to run:

    $ composer update

to be able to add the specified library to your vendor directory.
