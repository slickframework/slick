MVC - A pattern for user interfaces
===================================

Slick uses the MVC design pattern for web application development.

    "Model–view–controller (MVC) is a software pattern for implementing user interfaces.
    It divides a given software application into three interconnected parts, so as to separate internal
    representations of information from the ways that information is presented to or accepted from the user.
    The central component, the model, consists of application data, business rules, logic, and functions.
    A view can be any output representation of information, such as a chart or a diagram. Multiple views of
    the same information are possible, such as a bar chart for management and a tabular view for accountants.
    The third part, the controller, accepts input and converts it to commands for the model or view."
